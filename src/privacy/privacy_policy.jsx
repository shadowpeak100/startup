                <p>Your privacy matters to us, that's why we fully disclose that this has no professional backing. I'm
                    just a student and
                    know how to make things and am learning still to protect them. So here are some things not to
                    upload:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your social security</li>
                    <li>The complete genome of your first born child</li>
                    <li>Government secrets</li>
                    <li>Your anniversary date - we can't help you remember that</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Feel free to have fun and explore! This is just a fun way for other hobbyists to connect and share
                    code in a unique project
                    combining hardware and software</p>
