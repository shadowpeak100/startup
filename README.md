# Motor Music

Motor music is a fun way to learn hardware and software,
it teaches valuable skills and makes programming fun and
tangible. The process involves finding a song you like, or
making your own, building a mini-circuit that connects 
stepper motors to software then coding that song to sound
on the stepper motors. The Motor Music website allows users
to share and collaborate on projects and receive tutorials on
how to set up their own machines

### Technologies ###
1. **Authentication:** Users will be able to create profiles to store their information and view liked songs
2. **Database:** The database will store song programs created by users as well as user information
3. **Websockets:** Under the songs, users will be able to commend their thoughts and opinion's on a song's quality

### Key Features ###

The website will be able to show the most popular songs, by like count. It will also have the
ability to show which songs have been newly published. The commenting feature will allow
users to interact and leave their thoughts on songs. In addition to this, users will be able to 
rate songs using a star system to promote favorites and especially well done songs. The application is
designed to be clean, simple and user friendly with essential features but a quick learning curve for 
all ages.

## Basic HTML ##
2/5/24

The website has been given some basic HTML, including some space for websockets where a live comment/chat system will go.
This will better facilitate the sense of community fostered on the website. I also added a cool code block to give a preview
for the different songs others have written.
