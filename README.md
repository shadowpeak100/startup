# Motor Music

Motor music is a fun way to learn hardware and software,
it teaches valuable skills and makes programming fun and
tangible. The process involves finding a song you like, or
making your own, building a mini-circuit that connects 
stepper motors to software then coding that song to sound
on the stepper motors. The Motor Music website allows users
to share and collaborate on projects and receive tutorials on
how to set up their own machines
